    'Biocentral columns are machine-learning predictions served by the [Biocentral API](https://biocentral.rostlab.org) (Rost lab, TUM). ProtSpace fetches the protein sequence from UniProt, submits it to the Biocentral models, and stores the returned per-protein prediction; all four columns are flagged ⚡ Predicted to distinguish them from experimental annotations. The underlying models (LightAttention, TMbed) take protein language model embeddings (ProtT5) as input rather than multiple sequence alignments, so predictions are available for any sequence regardless of homology to characterized proteins.',
  UniProt:
    'These columns come from the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), retrieved by ProtSpace through the [UniProt REST API](https://rest.uniprot.org) and attached to each protein as an annotation column.

Where an annotation carries supporting evidence, ProtSpace appends a UniProt evidence code after a pipe (`|`), ranked from experimental (`EXP`) down to electronically inferred (`IEA`) and drawn from a UniProt subset of the [Evidence & Conclusion Ontology](https://www.uniprot.org/help/evidences).',
  InterPro:
    '[InterPro](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) integrates predictive models ("signatures") from a consortium of member databases into a single classification of protein families, domains, and functional sites. ProtSpace queries the InterPro Matches API by MD5 sequence hash and exposes the per-member-database hits directly, one ProtSpace column per member database. Each value is a semicolon-separated list of `accession (name)|score` entries, where the score is the value reported by that database\'s own tool (a bit score for the HMMER-based members such as Pfam); higher means a stronger match, and scores are not comparable across different databases. Most members match a sequence against curated reference models of known families and domains, so ProtSpace treats them as reference annotations; the exception is Phobius (`signal_peptide`), a de-novo topology predictor, which carries the ⚡ Predicted badge.',
  Taxonomy:
    "The nine taxonomy columns trace the source organism up the standard Linnaean / NCBI rank ladder, from most general to most specific: **root → domain → kingdom → phylum → class → order → family → genus → species** (they are listed below in that rank order rather than alphabetically). ProtSpace takes each entry's `organism_id` and queries the [UniProt Taxonomy API](https://www.uniprot.org/help/taxonomy) (backed by [NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy)) to resolve them; `root` is the cellular/acellular split and `domain` the Bacteria/Archaea/Eukaryota level. Intermediate ranks are not defined for every lineage, so a given column can be empty for some organisms. Colouring by a rank is a quick way to see how organism provenance maps onto an embedding.",

      "Species is the most specific of the nine ranks, corresponding to the full binomial (e.g. _Homo sapiens_, _Escherichia coli_). It typically produces the largest number of distinct categories in a dataset, so it is best suited to multi-organism collections rather than single-proteome bundles. The value is the species-rank node for the entry's `organism_id` from [NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) via the UniProt Taxonomy API.",

      "TED ([The Encyclopedia of Domains](https://ted.cathdb.info/)) segments AlphaFold structures into domains by taking a consensus of three structure-based parsers — Chainsaw, Merizo, and UniDoc — and matches each against [CATH](https://www.cathdb.info/), whose four hierarchical levels are Class, Architecture, Topology, and Homologous superfamily (the four numbers in a code such as `2.60.40.720`). Each domain carries a pLDDT score, AlphaFold's per-residue model confidence on a 0–100 scale, here averaged over the domain's residues. ProtSpace fetches these per accession from the AlphaFold Database API and joins multiple domains with `;`, formatting each as `code (name)|pLDDT`, or `unclassified|{plddt}` when no CATH superfamily is assigned. The underlying resource was published by Lau, Bordin, Kandathil, Orengo, Jones et al. in [Science (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adq4946), describing nearly 365 million domains across the AlphaFold Database, of which roughly 77% of nonredundant domains match a known CATH superfamily.",

    detailsMarkdown:
      "pLDDT (predicted Local Distance Difference Test) is AlphaFold's own per-residue confidence measure, a 0–100 score written into the PDB B-factor column of every atom in a residue: >90 very high, 70–90 confident, 50–70 low, <50 very low. Unlike the other columns on this page, ProtSpace does not fetch this value from an API — `protspace bundle --structures` reads it directly out of the bundled `.pdb` files (ColabFold and AlphaFold2 both write pLDDT this way) and averages each structure's per-residue values into a single per-protein score. It is only present when the dataset bundles its own AF2 predictions rather than relying solely on the live AlphaFold DB structure viewer tab.",
