"""Centralized parquetbundle I/O operations.

A .parquetbundle file concatenates multiple parquet files separated by a
delimiter.  The first three parts are the core data tables; an optional
fourth part carries settings (annotation colours, shapes, etc.); an optional
fifth part carries projection statistics; an optional sixth part carries
bundled protein structures (raw PDB text, keyed by protein id).

Positional layout: ``core(3) + settings? + statistics? + structures?``.  When a
later optional part is present but an earlier one is absent, the earlier part
is written as **zero bytes** so later parts stay at their fixed position —
readers and writers branch on a part's emptiness, not on the raw part count.
